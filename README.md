### Functions

---

Select 5 programs that you have written for another homework assignment and rewrite the program as a function. The function version of the program must take at least 2 arguments. 

Each function should be in a separate Python file named `hw10-1-#.py` where `#` is the number of the function. Be sure to include at least 3 tests of each function. Each function will be worth 4 points.

*HINT: Any time you prompt a user for an input, pass this value as an argument to the function.*
